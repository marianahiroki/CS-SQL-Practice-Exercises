# CS-SQL-Practice-Exercises

## Description:

This repository contains a collection of SQL exercises completed during my comprehensive L3 Data Essential Skills Bootcamp in 2023. The exercises cover a range of topics, including data querying, manipulation, and database management. 
Each exercise is documented in Jupyter Notebooks, providing hands-on practice with SQL queries and database interactions. Dive into this repository to explore my learning journey and proficiency in SQL through these exercises.

## Contents:

- SQL exercises covering fundamental to advanced query scenarios
- Jupyter Notebook files illustrating SQL solutions and explanations
- Clear documentation and comments within the notebooks for enhanced understanding
- The flights db is part of the SQL_WorkBook.ipynb
- The Analysis of Mental Health Dataset was an optional assignment and considered very challenging due to further research needed outside of the topics covered

## Purpose:

Showcases practical application and understanding of SQL concepts gained from the Bootcamp. Demonstrates proficiency in database querying and manipulation skills through real-world exercises.

Explore the exercises to see SQL queries and database interactions in action!

## Comment:
- On exercise 7 of the Mental Health Practice I believe there is an error in the database as I checked with my instructor.
